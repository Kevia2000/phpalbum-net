This is an todo task list with 3 priorities:


1. Comming in next release ( on what we are working now)
   
   - possible to display thmbs in image view ... like a bar with icons or like that
   - to be able change the sorting of comments
   - size of thumbnail to thmb.tpl.php (also size of orig_pic for popup windows)
   - page numbers (i.e.    prev 2 3 4 5 next )
   - picture numbers ( prev 2 3 4 5 next )
   -- voting
   - 2 new themes

-- notices for todo (thoughts which must not be forgotten)
   - directories width variable in borders.
   - imageview image border color 

BUGS:
   - on FreeSBD the "." on the end of almost all ftp_chdir you get error, instead of that one 
     should delete the last back slash
   - email is published if you post some comment
     
2. Comming may be in overnext release ( will be done but not now )
   - background image
   - improved upload manager (delete more files in one step, rename/move files/dirs, delte full dirs )
   - new pictures indicator also for thumbnails
   - RSS-Support
   - rotate pictures
   - email notification if some comments are created
